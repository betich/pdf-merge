# pdf merge

a script used to merge all pdf files into one (used for collecting all my classmate's files and combining into one final output)

tl;dr i'm lazy

## setup

1. install python

2. install PyPDF2

```
pip3 install PyPDF2
```

3. put all pdf files into `src`

everything is sorted numerically, so:

for front covers, name it something low like `-99.pdf`

for back covers, name it something high like: `99.pdf`

4. run the code

```
python3 index.py
```

1. have fun!
